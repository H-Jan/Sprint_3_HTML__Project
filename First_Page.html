				<li class="list-group-item"> <p>There remains no greater indulgence in this world than things that leave us in awe and without words.
					In those rare moments of bliss, their enjoyment goes beyond the limited capacity of language itself. And that is precisely the difficulty
					many have struggled with in describing the feeling that overwhelms from viewing Las Meninas. Completed in 1656 by Diego Velazquez,
					the painting has baffled its audience ever since, <mark> captivating critical acclaim with its mysterious allure, popularized replications,</mark>
					and unrelentless debate among art aficionados and intellectuals alike. Yet, despite its nearly four hundred years of enthrallment,
					its audience remains small. Even still, Las Meninas should be recognized as the greatest painting of all time. To fully understand
					Velazquez’s masterpiece, we must rip it apart, inch by inch, and recognize the complexity behind its appearance. The first aspect
					is found at the borders of the painting - or the lack thereof. <mark> The frame on which the literal painting sits appears to intersect
					the room’s ceiling, floor, and windows, creating an inclusionary appearance. This aspect is heightened by the shockingly simple mixed
					array of elements, from the shadows that define the painting, the singular source of light, and rigid angles. </mark> Deeper still, the contents
					of the painting itself add to its complexity and allure. Dominating the left side of the painting, Velasquez depicts himself in his habitat
					as a painter at work, yet oddly enough, appears to pay little attention to either the canvas or figures of the painting. Rather,
					his gaze is directed towards what the viewer deduces as the figures reflected in the mirror, figures without detailed features,
					discernible only by their stately attire. </p>
					<p>
					Yet, Velasquez is not alone. All the figures, irrelevant of their presumed importance, are turned, gazing and glaring at the direction
					of the ambiguous king and queen. A point of magnificent intentionality, the gazes of these figures, in culmination with the shadowing,
					dimensions, and deduced borders, create an illusionary point of view opposite the mirror and outside the bounds of the painting itself -
					a geometric double centrality - landing precisely upon the audience. A startling realization dawns - the king and queen are simultaneously
					the viewers and the objects of the painting, its temporary audience and timeless focus. <mark> “The artist is caught painting what is in front of
					him, that is, external to the painted surface, where we are...a reflection of the relationship between fiction and reality, between illusion
					and truth” (Foucault). </mark> Jarringly, Velasquez captures a painting frozen in time, eternal, varying its contents in continuation of the present
					indulging in a closeness achieved with an unreplicable sense of vulnerability.  However, many have tried to capture precisely that.
					As iconosized by Picasso through his timeless statement that “Good artists copy, great artists steal”, countless artists have attempted
					to steal the nakedness with which Las Meninas enamours the art world, including Picasso himself. Beginning in 1957, Picasso created extended
					variations on Las Meninas, totalling 45 artworks by its end. <mark> The series served as a confrontation of what Picasso declared as one of the most
					important works in the history of the spanish people, as well as contemporary commentary on the events that gripped Spain. </mark> Salvador Dali followed
					foot in 1958, beginning his own interpretation of Las Meninas in honor of its tri-centennial birthday in 1960 to honor the Baroque movement
					he so dearly admired. Countless others, from Edgar Degas to Antonio de Felipe, would make their mark in history by replicating Velasquez’s
					painting with their own renditions and artistic flares, failing to achieve the unprecedented timelessness of Las Meninas, yet all the same
					generating their respective share of criticism that has dottedly defined the original masterpiece.
